# SystemCore Clone

A simple Raspberry Pi–based project for running **CAN** or **CAN FD** interfaces.


## Required Software
The following software is required to create, flash, and use the SystemCore image.

### Raspberry Pi Imager
Used to flash the operating system image to a microSD card.

### WPILib 2027 alpha
Match WPILib to the SystemCore image (see [wpilibsuite/SystemcoreTesting](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/SystemcoreTesting#software-compatibility)):
- image 13: [2027.0.0-alpha-6](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2027.0.0-alpha-6) with Phoenix 6 `26.50.0-alpha-1` (what the example projects use)
- image 14: [2027.0.0-alpha-7](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2027.0.0-alpha-7) (no Phoenix 6 release for it yet)

### SystemCore Base Image
This is the base os image used if you are preperaing or setting up your own image instead of using Bobcat's Prebuilt image. The overlays in this repo need image **13 or newer**.

## Required Hardware
The following hardware that we have tested with 

### Raspberry Pi 5 4 GB
A standard Raspberry Pi 5 with 4GB of memory is as close to the specs as you will get.

### CAN HAT - NO FD
This is the exact hat that was purchased from amazon for this project that does not support FD (Waveshare "2-CH CAN HAT", not the "HAT+"). Set its VIO jumper to 3.3 V.
